## Module Descriptions

### Game Engine (`/game`)
The core game logic including:
- **Cards**: All card definitions organized by affinity
- **Types**: TypeScript interfaces and types
- **Systems**: Game mechanics implementations
- **Utils**: Helper functions for game operations

### Start Menu (`/startmenu`)
Main menu interface with options to:
- Start new game
- Open inventory
- Access settings
- Quit game

### Inventory (`/inventory`)
Card collection management featuring:
- View all owned cards
- Filter by affinity, level, etc.
- Sort cards by various criteria
- Track card experience and stats

## Key Features

### Card System
- 4 affinities: Fire, Forest, Water, Sky
- Each card has individual file for maintainability
- Structured abilities that can be programmatically executed
- Leveling system with ability upgrades at levels 4, 7, and 9

### Leveling System
- Cards gain XP from combat (1 per kill) and nectar spending (1 per nectar)
- 9 levels with increasing XP requirements
- Custom stat gains per beast per level
- Ability evolution at milestone levels

### Ability System
- Programmatic ability effects (damage, heal, buffs, etc.)
- Multiple trigger types (OnSummon, OnAttack, OnDamage, etc.)
- Conditional effects and complex interactions
- Cost requirements for activated abilities

## Usage

### Main Application
```typescript
import { BloomBeastsApp } from './bloombeasts';

const app = new BloomBeastsApp();
await app.run();
```

### Direct Game Engine Usage
```typescript
import { GameEngine } from './bloombeasts/game/systems/GameEngine';
import { buildFireDeck, buildForestDeck } from './bloombeasts/game/utils/deckBuilder';

const engine = new GameEngine();
const player1Deck = buildFireDeck();
const player2Deck = buildForestDeck();

await engine.startMatch(player1Deck, player2Deck);
```

### Inventory Access
```typescript
import { Inventory } from './bloombeasts/inventory';

const inventory = new Inventory();
await inventory.initialize();
```

## Development Status

### Complete âœ…
- Core game types and structures
- All 4 starter decks with structured abilities
- Leveling system with XP tracking
- Ability processing system
- Basic UI placeholders

### In Progress ðŸš§
- Game engine integration
- Combat system implementation
- Save/load functionality

### Planned ðŸ“‹
- Multiplayer support
- Advanced deck building
- Tournament mode
- Card crafting system

## Next Steps
1. Connect UI components to game engine
2. Implement input handling
3. Add persistence layer
4. Create visual rendering system
