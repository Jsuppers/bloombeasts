# Battle System Refactoring Summary

## What Changed

The battle logic has been completely refactored from a tightly-coupled 800-line `MissionBattleUI` into a clean, reusable architecture.

## New Structure

    ├── MissionBattleUI.ts           # REFACTORED: Now a thin wrapper (~400 lines)
    ├── MissionBattleUI.old.ts       # Backup of original
    ├── BattleStateManager.ts        # MOVED to battle/core/BattleRules.ts
    └── OpponentAI.ts                # MOVED to battle/ai/OpponentAI.ts
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns

**Before:** Everything mixed together in MissionBattleUI
- Battle initialization
- Turn management
- Game rules (card effects, combat)
- AI logic
- Mission-specific features
- Reward calculation

**After:** Clean separation
- **BattleController**: Generic battle flow (any 2 players)
- **BattleRules**: Game rules engine
- **OpponentAI**: AI decision making
- **MissionBattleUI**: Mission-specific wrapper only

### 2. Player-Agnostic Design

The battle system now works with **any combination of players**:

```typescript
// Human vs AI (missions - current use case)
const battle = controller.initializeBattle({
  player1: { id: 'player', name: 'Player', deck: playerDeck },
  player2: { id: 'ai', name: 'Opponent', deck: aiDeck, isAI: true }
});

// Human vs Human (future multiplayer)
const battle = controller.initializeBattle({
  player1: { id: 'player1', name: 'Alice', deck: deck1 },
  player2: { id: 'player2', name: 'Bob', deck: deck2 }
});

// AI vs AI (testing, tournaments)
const battle = controller.initializeBattle({
  player1: { id: 'ai1', name: 'AI-A', deck: deck1, isAI: true },
  player2: { id: 'ai2', name: 'AI-B', deck: deck2, isAI: true }
});
```

### 3. Special Rules System

Missions can inject custom rules without modifying core battle logic:

```typescript
const battle = controller.initializeBattle({
  player1: { ... },
  player2: { ... },
  specialRules: [{
    id: 'masters-domain',
    name: "Master's Domain",
    description: 'Opponent starts with 40 health',
    apply: (gameState) => {
      gameState.players[1].health = 40;
      gameState.players[1].maxHealth = 40;
    }
  }]
});
```

### 4. Extensibility for Multiplayer

The architecture is ready for networked multiplayer:

```typescript
// Future: Networked player implementation
export class NetworkedPlayer implements IBattlePlayer {
  private connection: WebSocket;

  async executeTurn(): Promise<void> {
    // Wait for player action over network
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      this.connection.on('action', (action) => {
        // Process networked action
        resolve();
      });
    });
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Battle

```typescript
import { BattleController } from './battle';

const controller = new BattleController(asyncMethods, {
  onBattleEnd: (winner) => console.log(`Winner: ${winner}`),
  onRender: () => updateUI(),
});

const battle = controller.initializeBattle({
  player1: {
    id: 'player',
    name: 'Player',
    deck: playerDeck,
  },
  player2: {
    id: 'opponent',
    name: 'Opponent',
    deck: opponentDeck,
    isAI: true,
  },
});

// Check for victory
const result = controller.checkBattleEnd();
if (result) {
  console.log(`${result.winner} wins!`);
}
```

### Mission Battle

```typescript
import { MissionBattleUI } from './screens/missions/MissionBattleUI';

// Existing mission system still works - just cleaner internally
const missionBattle = new MissionBattleUI(missionManager, gameEngine, async);
const battle = missionBattle.initializeBattle(playerDeck);
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Code**: Each component has a single, clear responsibility
2. **Reusable**: Core battle system works for any game mode
3. **Testable**: Components can be unit tested independently
4. **Maintainable**: Changes to battle logic don't affect missions, and vice versa
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new features:
   - Multiplayer (networked players)
   - Tournament mode
   - Practice mode (vs adjustable AI)
   - Spectator mode
   - Replay system

## What Stayed the Same

- **Game rules logic**: BattleStateManager/BattleRules unchanged
- **AI behavior**: OpponentAI unchanged (just moved)
- **Mission system**: Still works exactly the same from the outside
- **UI integration**: BattleScreen still receives the same data

## Migration Notes

The old `MissionBattleUI` is backed up as `MissionBattleUI.old.ts` if you need to reference it.

All imports have been updated and TypeScript compiles without errors.

## Next Steps

Now that the battle system is generic and player-agnostic, you can:

1. **Add Multiplayer**: Implement `NetworkedPlayer` for real-time PvP
2. **Add Practice Mode**: Let players battle adjustable AI without missions
3. **Add Tournament Mode**: Run brackets with multiple players/AIs
4. **Add Replay System**: Record and playback battles
5. **Add Spectator Mode**: Watch battles in progress
