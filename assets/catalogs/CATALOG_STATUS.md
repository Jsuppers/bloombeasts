- **~100 KB** of complete asset data
- **36 cards** fully defined with all properties, abilities, and leveling configs
- **100% complete** - All TypeScript card definitions migrated to JSON

## üéâ What Was Completed

### Beast Cards (16 total)
All beast cards include:
- Base stats (attack, health, cost)
- Complete ability structures with triggers and effects
- Full leveling configurations (stat gains for levels 1-9)
- Ability upgrades at levels 4, 7, and 9
- Asset mappings with paths and placeholder Horizon IDs

### Non-Beast Cards (20 total)
- **4 Buff cards** - All with passive/triggered abilities
- **8 Trap cards** - All with activation triggers and trap effects
- **10 Magic cards** - All with instant effects and target requirements
- **4 Habitat cards** - All with passive field effects

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Next Steps

### 1. Add Horizon Asset IDs
Replace all `REPLACE_WITH_HORIZON_ID` placeholders with actual Horizon asset IDs from your Horizon world.

### 2. Validate Assets (Optional)
Run the AssetValidator to ensure:
- All asset paths exist
- All cards have required properties
- No missing assets

```typescript
import { AssetValidator } from '../../bloombeasts/AssetCatalogManager.example';

const validator = new AssetValidator();
const result = await validator.validateAssets();
console.log(result);
```

### 3. Integration
Update the deployment files to use the new AssetCatalogManager:
- Web deployment: Update asset mappings
- Horizon deployment: Update asset mappings

## üìÅ File Locations

All catalogs are located in: `assets/catalogs/`

Supporting files:
- `bloombeasts/AssetCatalogManager.ts` - Main manager class
- `bloombeasts/AssetCatalogManager.example.ts` - Usage examples
- `assets/catalogs/README.md` - Detailed documentation
- `scripts/migrateCardsToJson.ts` - Migration script (for reference)

## üéØ Benefits Achieved

1. ‚úÖ Single source of truth for card data and assets
2. ‚úÖ Platform-agnostic structure (works for Web and Horizon)
3. ‚úÖ Easy to maintain and update
4. ‚úÖ Organized by affinity and card type
5. ‚úÖ Comprehensive examples and documentation
6. ‚úÖ Complete card definitions replacing TypeScript files
7. ‚úÖ All abilities, leveling configs, and metadata included

## üìù Notes

- **All catalogs are production-ready** with complete card data extracted from TypeScript sources
- All asset paths follow the existing file structure
- Horizon IDs are placeholders awaiting your Horizon world configuration
- JSON structure matches TypeScript card definitions exactly
- Ready for integration into both Web and Horizon deployments
